Mann-Kendall Test For Monotonic Trend

The purpose of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test (Mann 1945, Kendall 1975, Gilbert 1987) is to statistically assess if there is a monotonic upward or downward trend of the variable of interest over time. 
A monotonic upward (downward) trend means that the variable consistently increases (decreases) through time, but the trend may or may not be linear.
